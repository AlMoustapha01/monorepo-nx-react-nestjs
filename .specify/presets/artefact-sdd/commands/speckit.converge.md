## Project Stack (artefact-sdd)

Read `.specify/stack.yml` first: it names this project's branches, commands, test files and convention files. `commands.test` and `commands.affected` are required: when one is missing, or the file itself, stop and ask the user to write it. Any other key that is absent or `null` skips the step that uses it: say so in the report, never invent a command. An absent key never removes a test: tests always run, with what `tests.needs` lists.

## Language (artefact-sdd)

Write the artifacts in the project language: `language` in `.specify/memory/language.yml`, a BCP 47 code (`fr`); English when the file does not exist. What stays as the template or the tools write it, in every language: the headings of the templates (`## Requirements`, `### User Story 1 - …`, `## Complexity Tracking`: commands and reviewers find sections by them), the markers that the trace command reads (`**Status**:` and its values `Draft`, `Implemented`, `Shipped`, `Retired`; `**Product Requirements**:`; `**Acceptance Scenarios**`; `**Retired**`), the `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers that commands look for, the task lines (`- [ ] T001 [P] [US1] …`), the ids (`003-US1-AS2`, `PAY-03`, `E03-J1`, `P1`) and the YAML keys of `specs/product.yml`. Commit messages, code, identifiers and test titles stay in English. A file still written in another language: write what you add or rewrite in the project language, and leave the rest as it is.

## Test Coverage of Acceptance Scenarios (artefact-sdd)

These rules come from the constitution (Test-First principle) and take precedence over any instruction above that contradicts them. They keep the append-only contract above: existing tasks are never edited or reordered.

- For every acceptance scenario (Given/When/Then) in `spec.md`, identified as `<feature number>-US<story>-AS<n>` (`003-US1-AS1`, …), find the automated test that covers it, at the level given by the plan's Test Strategy.
- Run the trace command first (`commands.trace specs/<feature>`): it maps each scenario id to the test files whose titles cite it, and lists orphan ids (tests citing a scenario that is not in the spec). Without it, build the same matrix by searching the files of `tests.globs` for each id. Use the matrix as the starting point, then check that each mapped test actually asserts its scenario; a test that cites an id without checking the behavior is a gap.
- A scenario without a covering test is a gap, even when the code seems to implement it. In the Convergence phase you append, emit the test task first, before any implementation task appended for the same scenario.
- An orphan id means the spec changed or the test is mislabeled: append a task to fix the test title or the spec.
- A test that cites a retired scenario (`N. **Retired** …` in `spec.md`, or any scenario of a `Retired` spec) is stale: append a task to remove the test, or to retire the behavior it checks.
- When every active scenario of the spec has a test and you report **Converged**, set the spec's `**Status**` from `Draft` to `Implemented` (the only edit to `spec.md` allowed here). From then on, when CI runs the trace command, it fails if a scenario loses its test.
- Never report **Converged** while a scenario has no test or while the trace command exits with an error. Quote its final matrix in your report.

## Gaps and Tasks (artefact-sdd)

These rules also take precedence over the instructions above, including "Little or no code yet: treat the entire specified scope as missing".

- **Already planned.** A gap that an open task of `tasks.md` already covers, unchanged, gets no new task: list it in the summary as "covered by T0xx". Append only what no open task covers, or what an open task gets wrong (then say which one).
- **Partial implementation.** Converge can run after `/speckit-implement` stopped part-way: assess what is done, and treat the open tasks as planned work.
- **Blocked from outside.** A task that cannot be done as planned (an image or a service no longer available, a dependency that does not do what `research.md` assumed) is a decision for the user: append one task that names the blocker and the options, says that the decision goes back to `/speckit-plan`, and names the blocked tasks it must be done before. It is appended first in the new phase, like any other task: never move an existing task.
- **Unrequested but justified.** Code that no task asked for but that a done task made necessary (a test fixed because a route became public), with its reason in the commit or in `tasks.md`, is not a gap.
- **Severity in the task.** End a task appended for a CRITICAL or HIGH finding with its severity: `… per FR-001 (missing, CRITICAL)`.
- **Fresh test runs.** Before reporting **Converged**, run the end-of-story checks without cache (`commands.fresh`, or `commands.affected` when it has no cache) and, when `e2e` is set, the journeys without cache (`e2e.fresh`, or `e2e.command` when it has none): a cached result proves nothing about the code as it is now.

## Independent Review (artefact-sdd)

An agent judges its own work generously: the work is reviewed by a reviewer that did not write it, in a fresh context, before converge concludes.

- When this pass finds no remaining gap for the user stories implemented on this branch (one story per pull request), get an independent review following `.specify/extensions/artefact-product/agents/relecteur.md`, before handing the story over and before reporting **Converged**. Launch the `relecteur` subagent. If your agent cannot launch it, ask the user to run `.specify/extensions/artefact-product/agents/relecteur.md` in a new session, with the same inputs only, and paste its report. When the project has no `.specify/extensions/artefact-product/agents/relecteur.md` yet, ask the user who reviews and how; never report **Converged** on your own review.
- Give the reviewer only the base (`origin/<branches.base>`, or the default branch without it) and the feature directory: never your summary, your reasoning or your opinion of the work.
- Each blocking finding becomes appended tasks, under the append-only contract above; when it concerns an acceptance scenario, the test task comes first. Do not hand the story over, nor report **Converged**, while a blocking finding is open.
- You may dispute a finding only with evidence (the code or test that disproves it). A disputed finding stays open: report it with that evidence, do not report **Converged**, and let the user decide (they close it, or it becomes a task); never drop it silently.
- Quote the reviewer's verdict, and the items it left to human review, in your report.
